# navigation_system
Navigation command system: 

final2.py takes in audio input from microphone and is able to converse with user if they want to navigate somewhere within Unity Hall. I used nav_classifier.py to determine which room/floor the robot wants to go to. The system will also be able to start the nav stack once I finish testing that file. 

Terminal command run line: 
python final2.py
